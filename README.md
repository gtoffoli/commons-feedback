# commons-feedback
 
Currently, just the 'stub' of a *Django* application supporting [CommonSpaces](https://github.com/gtoffoli/commons) and associated sites in the management of a mobile app that will collect student/attendee reactions to a synchronous lecture/event. It was generated following the *channels* [tutorial](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html) referring to the design of a simple chat application.

The objectives and the initial design ideas of both the mobile app and the Django application are set out in the blog article [The design of a Student Feedback App](http://www.we-collab.eu/weblog/6/).
